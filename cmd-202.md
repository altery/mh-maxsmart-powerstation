### CMD `202`: Configure master/slave ports

Configures ports for master/slave operation.

Slave ports are automatically switched on or off based on the power consumption
of a master port.

#### Request
```
GET http://<ip>/?cmd=202&json=%7B%22sn%22:%22SWP1234000000000%22,%22master%22:%5B1,0,0,2,2,2%5D,%22limit%22:0%7D
```

Formatted JSON:
```
{
  "sn":"SWP1234000000000",
  "master":[1,0,0,2,2,2],
  "limit":0
}
```

##### Field description

| Field            | Description                                                |
| ---------------- |------------------------------------------------------------|
| sn               | The serial number of the device |
| master           | The operational mode of every port. The first entry in the array is port 1.<br>`0`: Port acts as slave<br>`1`: Port acts as master (trigger). *There can only be a single master port.*<br>`2`: Port is neutral (not part of master/slave configuration)|
| limit             | The threshold of power for the master port. If the master port consumes more than the threshold, all slave ports will switch on. This should be set to a value that is above above the stand-by consumption of the master device, but below the operation consumption.<br>`0`: 2 W<br>`1`: 5 W<br>`2`: 10 W<br>`3`: 35 W |
