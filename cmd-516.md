### CMD `516`: Query rules

Queries the configured rules. A rule is like a schedule for a port. A rule can
either be a one-time event for a specific point in time:

- "Turn port 1 on at 2018-10-11T14:00:00Z"

Or a rule can be a repeated schedule:

- "Turn port 2 off every Monday and Tuesday at 22:10:00"
